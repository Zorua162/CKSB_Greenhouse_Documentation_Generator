+ Added icons to the document

Note: folders containing item and block textures are also currently required for this script.

To get the icons to auto generate they need to be unzipped from the minecraft jar file.

To get these files with MultiMc:
Go to `/MultiMC/libraries/com/mojang/minecraft/<current.version.number>`.
Unzip this jar archive.

Copy/Move the folders `/minecraft/textures/block` and `/minecraft/textures/item'
to the same directory as the script.
